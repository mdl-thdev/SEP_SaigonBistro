### Features Left to Implement


##  Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **HTML5**  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML  
  HTML5 was used to structure the content of the web application and define the layout of pages.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  https://tailwindcss.com  
  Tailwind CSS was used to style the application efficiently using utility-first classes, enabling a clean, responsive, and consistent design.

- **Vanilla JavaScript**  
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript  
  JavaScript was used to implement front-end interactivity, handle user actions, and manipulate the DOM for dynamic content updates, and communicate with backend APIs.


### Backend

- **Node.js**  
  https://nodejs.org  
  Node.js was used as the runtime environment to execute server-side JavaScript and build the backend logic.

- **Express.js**  
  https://expressjs.com  
  Express.js was used to create RESTful APIs, handle HTTP requests, and serve static frontend files.

- **bcryptjs**  
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs  
  bcryptjs is used to securely hash user passwords before storage. This ensures that plaintext passwords are never stored and improves overall authentication security. Passwords are verified by comparing hashed values during login.

### Data Storage

- **Supabase**  
  https://supabase.com
  Supabase is used as the primary backend service for data storage and management. It provides a hosted PostgreSQL database along with authentication and API access.
